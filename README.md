#SMARTJUDY 
A comprehensive case management website for a law firm. It facilitated efficient case flow and communication between clients and advocates. Clients registered on the platform and posted cases, specifying whether they were criminal or civil. For instance, in a road accident case, required documents like the car number and driving license had to be uploaded. Senior advocates could view these cases on their dashboard and either take them up themselves or assign them to junior advocates. The application tracked the status of each case, such as hearing dates or case completion. Additionally, it included a chat feature for clients and their assigned advocates to discuss case details. The tech stack comprised HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. Key challenges included ensuring secure document uploads, efficient case status tracking, and implementing real-time communication.
